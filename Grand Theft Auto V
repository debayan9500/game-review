The attentian to detail is amazing. Im a car enthusiast so i love trying to collect all the cars. When i got the game i didnt know it would be this good. Im getting it almost 8 years after it released and its quickly become my favorite game. From the blow off valve sounds in a turbocharged vehicle to sound of an engine cooling down after its been turned off i continue to find evidence of rockstars hard work to make this game realistic and fun at the same time.

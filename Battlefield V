Takes me back to days of Battlefield 1942.  Certainly it isn't quite on that level of stardom, I mean the late 90s/early 2000s was a special time for PC gaming and WWII shooters in particular, but it does do a great job getting back on track to what was lost around the turn of the century.  Beautiful sounds and graphics, freedom to roam through the map and a variety of vehicles, I can't understand why this game has such a poor rating.

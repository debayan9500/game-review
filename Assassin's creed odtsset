Honestly this is a great game. NO MATTER WHAT!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game for yourself, best graphics/cutscenes!!! Also another bonus is if u get GOLD EDITION or DELUXE EDITION you get extra stories to add on making it that much more worth playing. It‚Äôs basically like playing a movie. This is a game where u control overall everything. From choosing quests to choosing who lives and dies. There‚Äôs multiple ending so feel free to choose how u would if (you) where the main character. I RECOMMEND for anyone new to try the EXPLORATION MODE ‚ÄºÔ∏è First this keep its simple while also having very little to mild combat. U have a good enough time level up your character at a good pace, while also collecting weapons,quest items, gear & much more. The choices  you make determines the outcome of the story. Wether there good or bad, you‚Äôll be the one to deal with the outcome. With that being said this is one of the best series of a GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED ‚ÄºÔ∏è I Believe everyone should play this game or at least give it a chance if u haven‚Äôt played the game. In conclusion I also would say to start the series from the beginning meaning (When you play the first assassin‚Äôs creed your going to be in for a hell of a ride and if u want something that doesn‚Äôt END QUICK !!!! This is the game for you.  Just play all TBH ü§ù

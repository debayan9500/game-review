Max Payne 3 was an interesting one seeing that it kinda removed all original elements Max Payne 1 and 2 had. But without Remedy working on it, it just didn't feel the same since they did really great on the first two games but Rockstar actually impressed me when I first played this game. I played it on the PS3 then I got it on PC. And I realized how it's such a great game. Not like the first two, but I gotta say that this is a masterpiece. It's not as hard has the first game but it's harder than the second one. They did good on this game, including the soundtrack. But it can't top Max Payne 1 and 2. Even though it's a lot longer, I just prefer the natural style it had. But man, such a great game.
